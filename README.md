# Minecraft.CheatMenu
Cheat Menu Minecraft plugin



This plugin creates a scaling GUI "cheat menu" which a user can open to see their available commands (if added into the config.yml)

Server owners can add items into the config.yml file and attach them to a command that will be called when a user clicks on that item.
Commands and permissions must be set in order for these items to appear, as this plugin will only show a user items for commands that they have correct permissions to use.
